## How It's Made:

Built using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the idea to be used as a template for future projects.

Altought its a simple single static page, it contains most of the commponents and sections that modern and complex websites use, making very easy to recycle and reuse them for future projects

## Optimizations

Following the responsive web design methodology, images have been optimized for different types of devices by using a combination of compression and making use of duplicated images (webm + png), serving each one depending on the user screen browser.

The source code has also been written following the DRY principles in order to avoid redundancy.

## Biggest Lessons Learned:

- Using responsive design based on break points instead of fixed resolutions
- Taking account of color contrast for accesibilty issues
- Checking with https://caniuse.com/ the usability of diferent modules for older
- Clean and modern web design guidelines

## Examples:
